[01:06.40] I haven't hear your echo
[01:08.11] Hiding in the wind for many years
[01:11.44] But somehow
[01:12.80] You're darkening my shadow
[01:14.94] Bittering the salt within my tears
[01:18.52] Another world, another time
[01:21.47] You where the one who saved me, open my eyes
[01:25.61] But you gave in, a welcome goodbye
[01:28.83] Why now, have you come back to be my
[01:32.72] Shadow form within
[01:34.73] Was it never enough to watch you decay
[01:38.01] Or was it the light beaming form an other time
[01:42.24] That keeps you from the fade away?
[01:45.48] Oh my shadow from before
[01:47.80] Should've never allow you to begin
[01:51.48] Forever am I tied to the mem'ry you created
[01:55.98] Yet you linger somewhere within
[02:12.35] Try as you might, are you frustrated
[02:15.34] With the fact that I moved on whit out you
[02:19.19] And in the light you're dissipated
[02:22.14] In a moment you'll be gone
[02:24.71] Another world, another time
[02:27.79] You where the one who saved me, open my eyes
[02:31.75] But you gave in, a welcome goodbye
[02:35.02] Why now, have you come back to be my
[02:38.82] Shadow form within
[02:40.84] Was it never enough to watch you decay
[02:44.38] Or was it the light beaming form an other time
[02:48.24] That keeps you from the fade away?
[02:51.48] Oh my shadow from before
[02:54.14] Should've never allow you to begin
[02:57.64] Forever am I tied to the mem'ry you created
[03:02.19] Yet you linger somewhere within
[03:31.99] I haven't hear your echo
[03:33.65] Hiding in the wind for many years
[03:37.74] But somehow
[03:38.61] You're darkening my shadow
[03:40.63] Bittering the salt within my tears
[03:43.96] (Another world, another time)
[03:47.15] (You where the one who saved me, open my eyes)
[03:50.95] But you gave in, a welcome goodbye
[03:54.40] Why now, have you come back to be my
[03:58.26] Shadow form within
[04:00.90] Was it never enough to watch you decay
[04:03.89] Or was it the light beaming form an other time
[04:07.66] That keeps you from the fade away?
[04:11.28] Oh my shadow from before
[04:13.57] Should've never allow you to begin
[04:17.02] Forever am I tied to the mem'ry you created
[04:21.42] Yet you linger somewhere within
[05:04.37] Shadow form within
[05:06.77] Was it never enough to watch you decay
[05:10.24] Or was it the light beaming form an other time
[05:14.06] That keeps you from the fade away?
[05:17.51] Oh my shadow from before
[05:19.96] Should've never allow you to begin
[05:23.28] Forever am I tied to the mem'ry you created
[05:27.86] Yet you linger somewhere within
